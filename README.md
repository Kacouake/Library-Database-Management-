### Project Summary: Library Database Management System

This project aims to build a **Library Database Management System** to efficiently manage books, authors, members, and loans. The system's key goals are:

1. **Book and Author Management**: Catalog books and authors, linking them for easy reference.
2. **Membership Tracking**: Store and manage member details for borrowing activities.
3. **Loan Management**: Record and monitor book loans, including due and return dates.
4. **Reporting**: Generate insights like overdue books, loan history, and book counts by genre.
5. **Scalability and Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy with constraints and support future growth.

The system improves library operations and provides a structured way to manage resources.
